                <h1>Please note</h1>

                <p>Items listed on this site are Halal at least according to the <strong>Hanafi</strong> madhab.</p>

                <p>As such, the restaurants and butchers listed stock hand-slaughtered (HS) chicken and adhere to
                    generally understood cross-contamination standards. Any exceptions will be noted.</p>

                <p>This is a community effort, and we need your help!</p>

                <p>For any butchers listed on the spreadsheet, please ask them which restaurants they supply to, and let
                    us know via the Form link above.</p>

                <p>Because this project is currently in its early stages, we are currently focusing on halal products
                    available in Sydney/NSW.</p>

                <p><strong>How to use this site:</strong><br>
                    The site is divided into lists for Restaurants, Butchers, and General Foods.</p>

                <p>Each entry is classified according to its status, as below:</p>

                <p><strong>Verified - Halal</strong>: Both the supplier and the seller have been verified by our team OR
                    The product does not contain any problematic ingredients.</p>

                <p><strong>Confirmed - Halal:</strong> Either the supplier or seller have confirmed that this business
                    is halal/HS, and we are awaiting confirmation from the other party.</p>

                <p><strong>Pending Review:</strong> We have received a new entry and are currently looking to confirm
                    the status of this business/product.</p>

                <p><strong>Partially Halal:</strong> A restaurant provides some halal/HS meat, but there is a risk of
                    cross contamination with non-HS or non-halal meat, they sell haram products, etc OR Some
                    varieties/flavours of a product are halal, but not all.</p>

                <p><strong>Potential Issues:</strong> A company which previously supplied a halal product may now use
                    impermissible ingredients/non HS meat OR A restaurant/butcher will not confirm their supplier OR A
                    product contains impermissible ingredients.</p>

                <h2>Disclaimer</h2>

                <p>This is a not-for-profit, community led voluntary venture. Nobody involved makes any money from this.
                    We do not provide halal certification services, and we do not claim that any existing certifiers or
                    meat suppliers are misleading, invalid or not Halal. We recognise these claims and certifications as
                    valid. This site is simply a guide to halal products which meet our standards.</p>

                <p>Butchers and restaurants often change suppliers on short notice, especially during periods of low
                    availability. There's no guarantee that we can capture supplier changes but we will try our best to
                    highlight which businesses do this.</p>

                <p>Many restaurants listed here are taken from the <strong>Fresh Poultry App</strong>. However, this
                    simply means that their chicken is supplied by Fresh Poultry. They may still serve pork or other
                    haram meat, or supplement their chicken stocks using other suppliers (esp smallgoods and nuggets).
                </p>

                <p>Please be aware that we are in a process of verifying meat-based abattoirs and potential cross
                    contamination with pork products. This might sound alarming - so are the claims we're receiving. The
                    halal scene is a rapidly changing one, and so the information in this guide may at times be out of
                    date or incorrect. Please do your due diligence - we are not responsible for what you eat.</p>

                <h2>FAQ</h2>

                <p><strong>What's our deal with wholesalers and abattoirs?</strong><br>
                    Honesty and integrity. Not all information on dishonesty can be publicised online especially where
                    defamation lawsuits are involved. There's no domestic halal certification standard so anyone can
                    certify something as halal. “If I don't certify it, someone else will” is very common. Certification
                    is a race to the bottom; all parties are involved.</p>

                <p><strong>What’s the stand on Meat (beef and lamb)?</strong><br>
                    Machine-slaughter or stunning is not an issue (so far) for beef and lamb. Our issues revolve around
                    the potential for cross contamination with non-halal meats. Wholesalers mix and match abattoirs, to
                    guarantee that the customer (shop/butcher) gets the full quantity of what they ordered. There are
                    fatawa that permit limited cross contamination, but honestly, Muslims deserve better than beef mixed
                    in pigs blood for the reason of laziness - no export halal meat ever touches pigs.</p>

                <p><strong>What’s the stand on Chicken?</strong><br>
                    Hanafis do accept machine slaughter with conditions. These conditions aren't consistently met in
                    Australia. <a
                        href="https://pathwaytoilm.info/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/April-Article-English-9.pdf"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more here</a>. Hand-slaughtered chicken is the only method
                    of removing the majority of doubt currently existent in the abattoirs.<br>
                    Jury is out on CAS (aka gas stunning); a lot of the industry seems to be heading towards it. The
                    topic has been highly politicised and the viability of CAS stunning is still unknown. This means
                    there's no community leadership on the way forward both in terms of ensuring halal certified chicken
                    abattoirs stick with electric stunning, or finding a good way to accept Controlled Atmospheric
                    Stunning as the industry modernises.</p>

                <p><strong>What’s the stand on Turkeys?</strong><br>
                    We understand Turkeys to be hand-slaughtered as they don't fit in machine lines. Please alert us if
                    there's anything to the contrary.</p>

                <p><strong>What’s the stand on Ducks?</strong><br>
                    Hand-Slughtered. Necks are too thick. Please alert us if there's anything to the contrary.</p>

                <p><strong>What’s the stand on Quail?</strong><br>
                    Used to be Hand-Slaughtered exclusively in NSW until ANIC Halal tendered for a contract and said 'we
                    can certify you even if you move to machine slaughtered'. So now it's a mix.</p>
